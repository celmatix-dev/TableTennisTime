#TableTennisTime#

Sometimes you want to take a table tennis break, but you look around the office and there's no one who looks free for a game. Or maybe you have a pair but are looking for a double's match.

Enter TableTennisTime (TTT). After you request a match, if there's another request in the office that matches yours, TableTennisTime will alert you!

###Why is it called TableTennisTime?###

Because the acronym TTT kind of looks like a ping pong table.

###Where is the TTT Server?###

Host one using the code in [TableTennisTimeServer](https://github.com/sheelc/TableTennisTimeServer)

*Disclaimer:* This is my first Objective-C application. In fact, this whole project is really just to explore the language. Please let me know if there are better/more conventional ways of writing parts. Additionally, I still need to learn how to test in Objective-C (which is why the code is extremely dangerous and untested).
